# Computer Vision — Assignment 3: Edge Detection & Feature Extraction

**Subject:** Computer Vision (Y4)
**Institution:** IIT Jodhpur, Dept. of CSE & AI

## Problem
Implement classical image processing operations: spatial filtering, edge detection (Sobel, Canny), and local feature extraction. Outputs visualize filter responses across test images.

## Tech Stack
- Python, NumPy, OpenCV

## Key Files
- `assignment.py` — core implementation
- `assignment.ipynb` — interactive notebook
- `images/` — input images
- `outputs/` — processed results
- `b22ai045_3.pdf` — assignment specification

## Run
```bash
python assignment.py
# or open assignment.ipynb in Jupyter
```
