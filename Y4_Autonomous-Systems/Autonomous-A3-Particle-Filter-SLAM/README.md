# Autonomous Systems — Assignment 3: Particle Filter Localization

**Subject:** Autonomous Systems / Robotics (Y4)
**Institution:** IIT Jodhpur, Dept. of CSE & AI

## Problem
Implement a particle filter for probabilistic robot localization. The robot maintains a distribution of hypotheses (particles) over possible poses, updating them with motion and sensor models to converge on the true location.

## Tech Stack
- Python, NumPy, Matplotlib

## Key Files
- `particle_filter_project/` — full implementation
- `Autonomous_3.pdf` — assignment specification

## Run
```bash
cd particle_filter_project
python main.py
```
